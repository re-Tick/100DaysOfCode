    <h3>Lamborghini</h3>
    <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.

New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.

Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán, along with the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy and continues to produce tractors.</p>

    <h3>Super Cars</h3>
    <p>A supercar – also called exotic car – is a loosely defined description of street-legal, high-performance luxury sports car. Since the 2000s or 2010s, the term hypercar has come into use for the highest performing supercars. Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a vehicle manufacturer's lineup of sports cars.

In the United States, muscle cars were often referred to as "supercars" during the 1960s.
Europe
The Lamborghini Miura, produced from 1966–1973, is often said to be the first supercar.[1][2][3][4] By the 1970s and 1980s the term was in regular use, if not precisely defined.[5][6] One interpretation up until the 1990s was to use it for mid-engine two-seat cars with at least eight cylinders (but typically a V12 engine), a power output of at least 400 bhp (298 kW) and a top speed of at least 180 mph (290 km/h).[7] Other interpretations state that "it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match", "it should be sleek and eye-catching" and its price should be "one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own"[8] or regard exclusivity (i.e. limited production volumes) as an important characteristic.[4]

It is also claimed that the definition of a supercar has always been subjective and a matter of blind prejudice.[7]

United States
See also: Muscle car § Supercars
During the 1960s, cars that are now considered to be muscle cars were then referred to as supercars.[9][10]: 8  The term was sometimes spelled with a capital S.[11] In 1966 the sixties supercar became an official industry trend.[9]: 8  For example, the May 1965 issue of the American magazine Car Life includes multiple references to supercars and "the supercar club"[12] and a 1968 issue of Car & Driver magazine refers to "the Supercar street racer gang" market segment.[13] In the model name of the AMC S/C Rambler, the "S/C" is an abbreviation for "SuperCar".[14]

Since the decline of the muscle car in the 1970s, the word supercar came to mean a car that has high performance (such as those made by Ferrari or Lamborghini)[9]: 5  interpretations of the term are for limited-production models produced by small manufacturers for enthusiasts, and, less so, standard-looking cars modified for increased performance.[15]</p>

    <h3>Rolls Royce</h3>
    <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Limited is the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003.

Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced prior to 2003 other than being a major engine and other supplier prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.

The Rolls-Royce Phantom four-door sedan was the first product offered for sale in 2003. Since then, the company has expanded its product line to include extended wheelbase, two-door coupé, and convertible versions of the Phantom Sedan, as well as the smaller Ghost four-door sedan, Wraith two-door coupé, Dawn Convertible, and the Cullinan SUV.</p>

    <h3>Tesla Roadster</h3>
    <p>The Tesla Roadster is an upcoming all-electric battery-powered four-seater all-wheel-drive sports car concept in development by Tesla, Inc.[1] Tesla has claimed that it will be capable of 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds,[2][3] which would be quicker than any street legal production car as of the announcement in 2017.[4] The Roadster is the successor to Tesla's first production car, which was the 2008 Roadster.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Roadster should ship in 2023.[5] Musk said in a tweet that higher-performance trim levels will be available beyond the base specifications, including a SpaceX package which would "include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around the car" which would supposedly allow for dramatic improvements in "acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering".
In 2011, at the end of the production run of the original Tesla Roadster, Elon Musk suggested that a new version of the Roadster, without the Lotus chassis, would return to production by 2014.[7] The new Roadster was first teased in 2014.[8] At the time, it was also referred to as the Tesla Model R.[9]

In 2015, Musk suggested a new Roadster, capable of faster acceleration.[10][11][12] A tweet by Elon Musk in December 2016 reconfirmed a second Roadster was in the works, but still "some years away".[13][14] The second Roadster was designed by Franz von Holzhausen.[15]

A prototype of the Roadster was shown in a surprise moment at the end of the Tesla Semi event on November 16, 2017—during which a Roadster was driven out of the back of one of the semi-truck trailers to the song "Sabotage".[16] Musk explained the concept as: "The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars. Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche."[17] The car will retail for upward of $200,000;[18] test rides were given at the event for those who immediately paid the first $5,000 of a $50,000 deposit to pre-order the vehicle.[17][19][20][21] Additional information followed after the teaser, such as the various world-record speeds Tesla said it will break.</p>
